# js-rsync

Rsync implemented in node over http

## Why?

- It is node.js you can run in multiple platforms, we use that for easy electron integration

## Implementation

This is a fork of [ttezel/anchor](https://github.com/ttezel/anchor), thanks to Mihai Tomescu (matomesc@gmail.com) and Tolga Tezel (tolgatezel11@gmail.com) for the initial implementation. We will maintain this repo as we use it in internal projects and share our fixes-refactors as open source code.
